# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## This Prework Study Guide Webpage was made as a starting guide in my early software development role.   This guide allowed me to implement the foundations of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I learned it while leaving reminders of what was learned though out the process.


If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Usage

This webpage contains HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git version control.  If you open the devTools in you web browser, you can inspect the JavaScript running.  HTML was learned first to structure the page.  CSS was implemented to style the content.  JavaScript allow the page to function when the page displayed.  Git was used to save and then pushed to Git Hub.

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
